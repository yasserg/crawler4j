Features
- Issue 278: Add hooks in the webcrawler for better error handling (Avi)
- Issue 239: Add an option to tweak the URL before processing the page Added hooks to several errors where by default we log the error but allow the user to override those methods in order to do anything they want with those URLs (maybe list them and then try to process them later etc) Added a method which can be overridden by the user which enables the user to tweak the url before fetching it (Avi)
- Issue 276: Don't let a crawled URL to be dropped without proper logging. Each URL should be logged somehow so the user will know it was crawled. We shouldn't just drop URLs without logging them (warn / debug, depends on the case) (Avi)
- Issue 213: Upgrade all logging statements to use {} of slf4j - Slf4j optimizes string concatenation in logging statements by using {} placeholder. Upgrade all logging statements to use it. (Avi)
- Issue 213: Changed from log4j implementation to slf4j API - Removed any reference to log4j - Logging Implementations should be the user's choice and not the library choice. Instead I have inserted the slf4j API. (Avi)
